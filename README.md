Part 2: Glossary


Branch: a parallel version of a repository. It is contained with the repository, but does not affect the primary to main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the “live” version.

Clone: a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website’s server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

Commit: an individual change to a file ( or sets of files).

Fetch: adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

GIT: An open source program for tracking changes in text files.

Github: a code hosting platform for version controls and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere

Merge: takes the changes from one branch ( in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

Push: to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com

Pull: refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

Remote: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

Repository: contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file’s revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private
