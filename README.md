Branch Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

Clone When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

Commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.

Fetch Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.

GIT Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

Github GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

Merge Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.

Merge Conflict Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

Push - pushing sends the recent commit history from your local repository up to GitHub.

Pull - a pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.

Remote Repository A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.
